The Great Outdoors

This project portrays our ability to use CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

in this project i utilized everything i was taught over the course of my YearUp journey to make a select dropdown to search through an array.By doing this i was about to search and select different national Parks and display the results on a card which read out information about the park and location.

The dropdown fuction was also used to make a tab for mountains as well to display the coordinates of each peak.
